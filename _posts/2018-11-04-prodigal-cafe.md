Tucked away in a cozy little corner of the Tai Seng estate, Prodigal Cafe has been gaining popularity among coffee-lovers and cafe-goers alike<!--more-->. Some of you might find the name familiar, and that’s probably because you’ve heard of Prodigal Roasters, their sister outlet at Ang Mo Kio. Unfortunately, Prodigal Roasters is no longer in operation as of earlier this year. Fret not! Prodigal Cafe serves the same great coffee with an extended food menu!

## Coffee
Using their own roasted beans, Prodigal Cafe’s coffees are marvellous. Their wide variety of coffee drinks ensures that there is something for everybody.

_Coffee Flight_

For the coffee lovers, there is the Coffee Flight. It’s a double shot espresso where one shot is served as an espresso and the other is served as a white. It gives you an idea of how the espresso will taste on its own and with milk added, as the taste can differ quite a bit.

For the ice cream lovers (everyone really) and those who like their coffee a little sweeter, there is the Affogato. The Affogato is a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso poured over it. And yes, it tastes as good as it sounds.

_The Tragic_

And for those who live on caffeine alone, there are cold bottled coffees containing shots of espresso with milk, ranging from 2 to 4 shots. My friends and I tried the Tragic (3 shots + milk) and the effects were definitely felt in the later part of the day. (Friendly reminder: while caffeine works wonders, it’s not meant to be a replacement for sleep!)

## Aesthetics
Prodigal Cafe’s logo, a cute cartoon-ish depiction of the owner, is sure to make you chuckle. The huge backlit logo on the storefront is undoubtedly the first thing anyone would notice when approaching the cafe.

Prodigal looks pretty small from the outside, but upon entering, the interior actually felt spacious and not at all what I had expected. Its white walls, light coloured wooden furniture and warm lighting did a good job making the space feel larger and more comfortable for customers. Even their coffee equipment were white in colour!

On the right, you’ll notice a wall with a cheeky quote on it, which I believe they change from time to time. It’s a uniquely Prodigal Cafe piece of decoration that makes a lovely background for group photos or perhaps a stunning selfie.

Their dishes were very nicely presented. I particularly loved the wooden plate they used to serve the Coffee Flight (as shown above) and the Coffee Mayo fries (as shown below later).

## Seating
Prodigal Cafe is cozy little space, which also translates to, it does not have many seats available. There are about 20 odd seats inside, with different sized tables and countertop seats. Though seating is limited, they can accommodate varying group sizes of up to 6 people. There are benches outside as well for waiting or customers who simply prefer some fresh outdoor air.

We had to wait a short while before we could get a table for 6. The staff were very helpful in easing the wait, by helping to shift 2 customers who were occupying a 6 seater table.

## Price
At $5 for a cappuccino and $6 for an affogato, their coffees prices are pretty standard. On the other hand, ranging from $8 - $18, their food menu is slightly more on the pricey side. While they do not have service charge and GST, the service exceptional nonetheless. When I inquired about their beans, the staff were more than happy to answer my questions and even allowed me behind the counter to find out more about the beans!

_Fresh Cut Fries with Coffee Mayo_

## Food
Evident from their extensive coffee menu, Prodigal Cafe focuses on serving great coffee. Thankfully, they also have some brunch options, light bites and cakes. We tried the Fresh Cut Fries with Coffee Mayo — thick cut fries seasoned with paprika, cheese and the key ingredient, coffee mayo. I’m assuming coffee mayo is a special kind of mayonnaise created with coffee as one of its ingredients. Whatever the recipe, the dish was an absolute treat.

I’m very keen on trying out their other brunch options on my subsequent visits. Based on my in-depth Instagram investigations, I have concluded that the Grilled Cheese is their most popular dish. And the Fried Chicken Waffles just sounds so funky that I have to try it for myself.

Situated in a quiet, peaceful housing estate, Prodigal Cafe makes the perfect place to slow things down and enjoy a moment of calm amid a hectic week. Their wonderful service also goes a long way in making customers feel welcomed.
