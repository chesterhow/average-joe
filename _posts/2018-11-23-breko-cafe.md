A street of bars and bistros, Holland Village is known to come alive at night. In the day, it appears quiet and empty, but upon closer inspection<!--more-->, blending in among the surrounding bars, there is one store bustling with activity — Breko Cafe. Unlike the rest of the neighbourhood, Breko Cafe is wide awake and filled with customers all morning and afternoon. Be it for a morning cuppa, a lovely brunch or scrumptious meal, Breko Cafe never fails to draw a decent crowd.

## Coffee
Breko Cafe offers the standard espresso-based drink menu, with minimal variations available. Their coffees are from _La Ristrettos_, another local cafe. As usual, I ordered a cappuccino. Its appearance was so dark, it could have passed off as a mocha. It wasn’t impressive taste-wise either.

On another note, non-coffee drinkers rejoice! Ranging from teas to milkshakes to sodas, their drink menu has quite the spread to choose from. For those looking to chat over some beer, Breko Cafe also serves a variety of beers and ciders.

## Aesthetic
Instead of the increasingly popular white and bright aesthetic adopted by many cafes these days, Breko Cafe opted for a dimmer, more cozy theme, with hanging lights that provide adequate and warm lighting. Even so, Breko Cafe does not feel cramp or small, thanks to their really high ceiling. The ceiling is so high, they managed to fit a loft and still have sufficient headroom.

Each table is decorated with dried flowers in a vase, which magically makes every food photo taken look twice as aesthetic. Seriously though, check out the photos below and see for yourself!

## Seating
Despite its perpetual crowded state all morning and afternoon, there was never a long waiting line. Big and small groups alike, there were always enough seats for everyone.

For fans of alfresco dining, there are a few tables outside the cafe. These tables are fully sheltered, so there’s no need to worry about getting drenched or getting a tan.

At the back, there’s a staircase leading up to a loft area. With sofa seats, low coffee tables and a magazine rack, it seemed like a really cozy and chill zone.

## Price
$5 for a cappuccino is pretty standard, but after adding GST and service charge, it becomes an above average price for an average cup of coffee. Food wise, expect somewhere between $8 - $18 for brunch, $14 - $19 for mains and $9 - $15 for desserts (not inclusive of GST and service charge).

## Food
When it comes to food, you’ll be spoilt for choice at Breko Cafe. Not only do they serve brunch daily till 5pm, they also boast the full spectrum of western dishes — mains, pastas, burgers, salads, light bites, you name it!

_Matcha Pancakes_

Dessert-hunters will not be disappointed, as Breko Cafe has a full page dessert menu as well! We tried the Matcha Pancakes, one of their recommended dishes. Carefully arranged on a black plate, this dish was satisfying for both my eyes and my sweet tooth.

Though the coffee isn’t fantastic, everything else about Breko Cafe sure is. With many seats, lots of drinks, and even more food, this has been one of my favourite lunch destinations for the longest time. Give Breko Cafe a shot and you might just find yourself returning again very soon!
