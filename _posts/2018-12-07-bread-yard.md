Many know one-north as _that place_, full of fancy new office buildings and busy brisk walking adults. Yet one-north is also home to many great cafes<!--more-->. One of them being the well-known bakery cafe, Bread Yard. Since its humble beginnings, when they first opened on campus at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, Bread Yard has grown tremendously. Now occupying a respectable corner unit in the Galaxis building, Bread Yard is a popular favourite in the area.

## Coffee
Evident from the glowing sign outside the cafe, Bread Yard proudly serves Allpress coffee for their espresso-based drinks. I ordered a 5oz white. The temperature was just right, the latte art on point, and the coffee was well balanced. I really enjoyed my coffee and was throughly impressed.

Bread Yard also serves filter coffee, offering 2 different brew methods to pick from, the Kalita Wave or the Aeropress. That day, the beans for their filter menu were from Nylon Coffee, a renowned local coffee roaster. I tried their Kalita Wave brew. The coffee was served in tiny pot, together with a tiny coffee cup and saucer to drink from. On top of its cute presentation, it was also a very decent brew.

Standard drinks aside, they had a rather peculiar item on the menu — the _Salted Caramel Latte_. It appears to be a latte served in a glass with a luscious coating of salted caramel around the rim. I’m not sure if there was salted caramel in the latte itself, but the drink was definitely drool-inducing.

## Aesthetic
Bread Yard’s brick and wood aesthetic turned out fantastic. The harshness of its bare brick walls was softened by the wooden furnishing. The tall glass panels allowed sufficient natural light to illuminate the establishment. Its gentle brown hues and pleasant lighting made the cafe ever so inviting and comfortable.

## Seating
From the outside, Bread Yard might not look big but it can seat up to 72 people (according to its website). Though it does get somewhat squeezy when it’s crowded due to how close the rows of tables are to each other. On the plus side, since the tables are arranged in rows and are movable, you can easily combine the tables to fit any group size. In my visits thus far, Bread Yard has not been overly crowded or super packed. Yet another reason why I really like this cafe!

## Price
A $x for a white and $x for filter coffee, Bread Yard’s coffees are quite reasonably priced. From $x - $x, their food prices are also pretty standard, and what most would expect from cafe food. Fortunately, they do not have service charge and GST, the prices you see are what you get. Even so, their service standard was not compromised and the staff were really friendly too!

**Pro-tip:** If you look at the bottom of your receipt, you’ll notice a little note that grants you a special discount on your next purchase within the week. So keep your receipts if you plan on revisiting them soon!

## Food
As you can probably guess from their name, Bread Yard serves fresh bakes and pastries. The bread is displayed in a single wooden cabinet outside the cafe. Though it might not seem like much, it shows that they do not bake in excess. That just assures me that the bread they sell are always freshly baked.

Apart from pastries, they also serve a variety of food options. Their quinoa / brown rice bowls, unique to Bread Yard, are definitely one of the highlights. On top of that, they also have a brunch menu, toast, sandwiches and pasta to choose from.

In their peaceful little corner of one-north, Bread Yard is slowly becoming one of my favourite cafes in the area as it is almost never crowded. A quiet cafe, with good coffee and wifi, that always has the scent of freshly baked bread. What’s not to love?
