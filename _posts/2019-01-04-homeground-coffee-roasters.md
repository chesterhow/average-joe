The east side of the island is full of amazing things, as you probably might have heard<!--more--> from all your east-side friends. Among this list is Homeground Coffee Roasters, the pride and joy of coffee lovers in the east. Homeground occupies a single shophouse unit, a short walk away from 112 Katong mall, and they serve some of the best coffee I’ve ever had.

## Coffee
Homeground Coffee Roasters has definitely made a name for themselves in the industry for their excellent roasting. You might have heard of their well-loved espresso blends — _Vanta_ and _Glow in the Dark_. In my recent visit, I tried the Vanta on white, and wow! What a wonderful cup of coffee that was, really living up to its expectations.

Homeground also serves filter coffee, brewed on the V60 with their own roasted beans. I ordered the Kenyan single origin. It was served together with a small card, providing information about the coffee. I thought it was a nice touch, as it really shows their attention to detail about the beans they procured. And of course, as one would expect, the coffee was an absolute treat, delicious and well-balanced.

For the home brewers out there, Homeground does sell their beans, packaged beautifully in little tins. And if you bring your tin back for a refill, you’ll get a little discount! Saving the environment and money. That’s pretty awesome.

## Aesthetic
The cafe occupies a narrow but elongated space. Such spaces are hard to work with, but Homeground cleverly took advantage of their limitations. When I entered the cafe, it felt like I had entered an art gallery. They had framed up and hung up some artwork on the walls. Coupled with the spotlights, it really gave the impression of a gallery.

Something that really caught my attention is Homeground’s graphic design illustrations. They curate an illustration for each of their collaborations. These beautiful pieces have a very distinct and consistent art style. Its modern yet whimsical look always makes me stop to take a closer look. They have some displayed in the cafe, so you check them out while you’re there. But for those who are really curious, it’s all on their Instagram page as well.

## Seating
Homeground is pretty small but they can seat about 20-odd people. Their unique take on seating is definitely worth a mention. Instead of the tradition table and chair setup one would expect from a cafe, Homeground did something different with their long, narrow space. They lined both walls with benches and tables, allowing for adequate seating while not making the area feel small or cluttered. Seating side-by-side a friend instead of facing one another actually creates a more casual and intimate dining experience.

## Price
At $5.5 for a white and $6 for filter coffee, Homeground’s coffee is really fairly priced if you consider the assurance of a delicious cup of joe. They also serve burritos, which are about $12 - $15, and some pastries. Their prices are all pretty affordable and to top it off, they do not have a service charge and GST. Their service was excellent nonetheless, with friendly and passionate baristas.

## Food
If you like something light to go with your coffee, Homeground does serve pastries from Woodlands Sourdough. For those looking for a more filling option, Homeground has partnered with Das A Wrap, and they now serve burritos. While it isn’t exactly the widest selection, you’ll have no lack of food choices in Katong.

Homeground Coffee Roaster’s casual setting makes it the ideal place for great conversations. And their excellent coffee makes the journey to the east all the more worth it. Though cafes in shophouses may seem like a recurring trend, there’s just something quite special about this combination. I can’t quite put it into words, but drop by Homeground and you’ll get what I mean.
