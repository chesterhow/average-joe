Look closely, or you might just miss it… Of all the cafes in the CBD area, Maxi Coffee Bar is perhaps the tiniest of them all<!--more-->. Named after the owner’s pet dog, Maxi, the cafe is situated in Emerald Garden along the conserved shophouses of Telok Ayer.

## Coffee
What Maxi lacks in size, it makes up for in coffee. Maxi doesn’t roast their own beans, and they’re always using different beans from various roasters — both local and abroad.

_Coconut Cold Brew_

Apart from the usual coffee drinks, Maxi also offers some signature drinks that you won’t find elsewhere. The _Coconut Cold Brew_ is the perfect summertime drink (which, let’s be honest, is pretty much all year round). Cold brew made with coconut water, topped off with a slice of lime, is a refreshing treat you never knew you needed.

_Iced Cereal Milk Latte_

For those needing their daily caffeine hit, give the _Iced Cereal Milk Latte_ a shot. It’s made with milk that had cereal steeped in it, giving it a sweet malty taste you won’t get from regular milk. If you usually take your coffee with sugar, this sweet treat is a great alternative too.

## Aesthetic
Walking into Maxi, you’ll be greeted by its industrial-style blue walls, retro mosaic floor tiles and of course, the baristas themselves. While the tiny space might be a constraint to others, Maxi embraced their limitation and turned it into a unique experience. Separated only by a small countertop table, interaction with the baristas feel natural and easy.

Littered all over the walls are painted markings and tongue-in-cheek symbols. And don’t forget to look up! That’s where you’ll spot Maxi’s iconic neon “Out of Office” sign.

## Seating
As one would expect, Maxi’s seating situation is not the best. There are no more than 8 seats in the cafe and that would already be quite a squeeze. During the off-peak hours, Maxi is a peaceful, cozy getaway in the middle of the CBD. But when the peak hour hits, with everyone standing around waiting for their takeaway coffees, a big crowd in a small space is less than ideal. Maxi is great for a pick me up coffee, but it’s not at the top of my list for working spaces.

## Price
At $5 for a white and $7.50 for the iced cereal milk latte, Maxi’s prices are pretty reasonable and affordable. They also offer various toasts and pastries, priced from $4 - $10. To top it off, there is no GST or service charge!

_Miso PB Honey_

## Food
What’s coffee without a little something to chew on? Thankfully Maxi does have a toast bar, with options like the standard _Avo Feta Smash_, _Miso PB Honey_ and the slightly more adventurous _Vegemite Cheese_.

Maxi also supports local up and coming home bakers/chefs in their inaugural Saturday Remix-es. Previous remix-es include oozy cookies from Ng Li Tying, irresistible pastries from Eat by Nico, and locally made chocolates from Fossa Chocolate.
