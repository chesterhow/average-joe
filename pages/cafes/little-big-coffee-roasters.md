Hidden away in the heart of the Singapore’s biomedical hub, Biopolis, lies Little Big Coffee Roasters.<!--more--> Previously known as Drury Lane Coffee Roasters, the cafe has been faithfully serving and providing good yet affordable coffee to all; a definite favourite of many in the area.

### Coffee

As you can probably guess from their name, Little Big Coffee Roasters serves coffees brewed with their own freshly roasted beans. Be it espresso or filter, there are usually a few options to choose from.

During my visits, I tried their whites and filters. The whites were lovely, but note that the large option comes in a very big cup, which means a fair bit more milk. So if you like your coffee stronger you might want to go for the regular size instead. Filter-wise, I tried two different options on my first visit and both were somewhat underwhelming.

_Cold black_

While they do not offer any iced drinks, they have instead _cold whites_ and _cold blacks_ which are chilled coffees stored in really pretty reusable jars. They also have a _coffee milkshake_ for those looking for something apart from the traditional coffee offerings.

### Aesthetic

Stepping in, your attention will immediately be drawn to their striking turquoise coffee countertop. Bright and bold, it’s easily the most recognisable and iconic feature of the cafe. Its high ceiling and equally tall glass windows flood the place with natural light, really opening up the small space. The warm lighting and naked bulbs coupled with the scent of freshly baked pastries and coffee adds to the cosy homely vibe of the cafe. I can’t help but think how apt their name, Little Big Coffee Roasters, is.

### Seating

Though small in size, the cafe has a decent number of seats. At max capacity, they can seat about 20 people, and there’s even a high table in the middle for those who are just here for a quick coffee and would prefer not to sit. In my visits thus far, I’ve never had any difficulty getting a seat.

### Price

Little Big Coffee Roasters offers perhaps the most affordable coffee on this tiny island. At $3.80 for a white and $4.50 for a filter, I was thoroughly amazed. They also offer toast and bakes priced from $2.50 - $10. There is no GST or service charge as well, but the baristas were very friendly and polite nonetheless.

### Food

Little Big Coffee Roasters also offers toasts and bakes, which pairs wonderfully with a cup of joe. Their pastries are baked in-house, with options like _oatmeal cookies_, _brownies_ and _lemon loaves_. The toast menu is pretty extensive as well. We had the _smoked salmon toast_ and it was just delightful.

With such affordable prices, Little Big Coffee Roasters challenges the norm of elitist overpriced coffees set by the large multinational coffee chains — They Who Must Not Be Named. For those unfamiliar with the Biopolis area, Little Big Coffee Roasters can be a little hard to find, but if a quiet, peaceful and affordable cafe is what you seek, it might just be worth exploring.
